                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may send you emails about our products if you are our existing customer (on the basis of our legitimate interests) or, if you are our prospective customer when you expressly agree to that (for example, by signing up to our newsletter).&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are our existing customer, we may use the information we have about you (such as what product you previously bought from us, where you live, how old you are, how you use our website and app) to make predictions on what other products may be of interest to you. We will use that information to make our marketing emails and offers relevant to you. This type of personal data use is called ‘profiling’. We will do that on the basis of our legitimate interests.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use cookies and similar tracking technologies (for example tracking pixels in our marketing emails and website/app advertisements) and analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to collect information about your use of our website, app, services and your interactions with our marketing emails and advertisements. In addition, third party advertising platforms that we advertise our products on (for example, Facebook and Google) may also use their advertising cookies on our website. We will ask for your consent to the use of non-essential cookies, including third party cookies.

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Mosaic to obtain additional non-personal information.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosaic is a service provided by Experian, the credit reference agency. Experian holds information on the majority of households in the UK. It uses that information to create models into the ‘make-up’ of the UK population for characteristics across age, gender, number of adults and composition of the household and length of residency. It then uses that information to segment households based on their postcodes into groups and assigns predicted buying interests and behaviours to those groups. We may use the postcode based information obtained from Mosaic and combine it with the information we have about you to make our marketing communication and offers more relevant to you. This type of personal data use is also called ‘profiling’. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will use your personal data in this way </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the basis of our legitimate interests. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will not share your personal information with Experian.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you click on our advertisement on social media (for example, Facebook) or a website or app or another provider (for example, Mention Me who run our ‘Refer a Friend’ programs), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that provider will share with us information about you (the fact that you came to our website/app from their service.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share your name, email address</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone number, and other information, such as whether you made any purchases with us and how much you spent, for our advertising purposes with social media platforms and other third party advertising providers (for example, Facebook and Google). The third party advertising provider will use that information to match it against the list of their own users. If the email address or telephone number we give them matches with their list, they will use it to show you our advertisements on their platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third party advertising providers will also use that information to combine it with the information they hold on you (for example, your interests, likes, advertisements you previously clicked on) and match it with other </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">users of their services who share similar characterises. They will then show our advertisements to those other people. The third party advertising providers will use your data and the other “look like’ users’ data in this way as data controllers on the basis of their terms and policies that govern their users’ use of their services. They will not share any of that information with us. However, if you are one of such ‘look like’ users of the third party advertising provider, and come to our website/app by clicking on our advertisement on that provider’s platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we will know that you came to us that way.</span></p>

Typically, consent would be gathered using a cookie pop-up.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, the limitation period for the making of- or defending against claims, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</span></p>

                        <h1>D2MS Privacy Notice</h1>

                        <p>We are BLUE ORANGE LIMITED. We’re a company registered in England and Wales with company number 11179221, whose registered
                            address is at A And L, Suite 1-3 Hop Exchange Southwark Street, London, England, SE1 1TY. In this privacy notice, we will refer to
                            ourselves as ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’. We are the Data Controller of the personal information we collect, hold and use about you, as explained in
                            this notice.
                            You can get hold of us in any of the following ways:
                            a. by phoning us on 07377463798;
                            b. by emailing us at iain@d2ms.co.uk; or

                            We take the privacy, including the security, of personal information we hold about you seriously. This privacy notice is designed to inform
                            you about how we collect personal information about you and how we use that personal information. You should read this privacy notice
                            carefully so that you know and can understand why and how we use the personal information we collect and hold about you.
                            We have appointed Iain Reid as our data protection officer. You can contact them using the details set out above.
                            We may issue you with other privacy notices from time to time, including when we collect personal information from you. This privacy
                            notice is intended to supplement these and does not override them.
                            We may update this privacy notice from time to time. This version was last updated on 15 November 2021.
                            Key definitions
                            The key terms that we use throughout this privacy notice are defined below, for ease:
                            Data Controller: under UK data protection law, this is the organisation or person responsible for deciding how personal information is
                            collected and stored and how it is used.
                            Data Processor: a Data Controller may appoint another organisation or person to carry out certain tasks in relation to the personal
                            information on behalf of, and on the written instructions of, the Data Controller. (This might be the hosting of a site containing personal
                            data, for example, or providing an email-marketing service that facilitates mass distribution of marketing material to a Data Controller’s
                            customer base.)
                            Personal Information: in this privacy notice, we refer to your personal data as ‘personal information’. ‘Personal information’ means any
                            information from which a living individual can be identified. It does not apply to information that has been anonymised.
                            Special Information – certain very sensitive personal information requires extra protection under data protection law. Sensitive data
                            includes information relating to health, racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious and similar beliefs, trade union membership,
                            sex life and sexual orientation and also includes genetic information and biometric information.
                            Details of personal information that we collect and hold about you
                            Set out below are the general categories and details of retention periods in relation to those categories (see section 8 below for more
                            details about retention) and in each case the types of personal information that we collect, use and hold about you:

                            The types of personal data we collect about you may differ from person to person, depending on who you are and the relationship
                            between us.
                            Details of special information that we collect and hold about you

                            Details of how and why we use personal information
                            We are only able to use your personal information for certain legal reasons set out in data protection law. There are legal reasons under
                            data protection law other than those listed below; but, in most cases, we will use your personal information for the following legal reasons:
                            a. Contract Reason: this is in order to perform our obligations to you under a contract we have entered into with you;
                            b. Legitimate Interests Reason: this is where the use of your personal information is necessary for our (or a third party’s) legitimate
                            interests, so long as that legitimate interest does not override your fundamental rights, freedoms or interests;
                            c. Legal Obligation Reason: this is where we have to use your personal information in order to perform a legal obligation by which we are
                            bound; and
                            d. Consent Reason: this is where you have given us your consent to use your personal information for a specific reason or specific
                            reasons.
                            As explained in section 3 above, there are more sensitive types of personal data, which require higher levels of protection. Where we
                            process such sensitive types of personal data, we will usually do this in the following circumstances:
                            a. We have your explicit consent;
                            b. Where it is necessary in relation to legal claims;
                            c. Where you have made the personal data public.
                            So that we are able to provide you with goods and services, we will need your personal information. If you do not provide us with the
                            required personal information, we may be prevented from supplying the goods and services to you.
                            It is important that you keep your personal information up to date. If any of your personal information changes, please contact us as soon
                            as possible to let us know. If you do not do this, then we may be prevented from supplying the goods and services to you.
                            Where we rely on consent for a specific purpose as the legal reason for processing your personal information, you have the right under
                            data protection law to withdraw your consent at any time. If you do wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us using the details set

                            which case, we will confirm that reason to you.
                            We have explained below the different purposes for which we use your personal information and, in each case, the legal reason(s)
                            allowing us to use your personal information. Please also note the following:
                            a. if we use the Legitimate Interests Reason as the legal reason for which we can use your personal information, we have also explained
                            what that legitimate interest is; and
                            b. for some of the purposes, we may have listed more than one legal reason on which we can use your personal information, because the
                            legal reason may be different in different circumstances. If you need confirmation of the specific legal reason that we are relying on to use
                            your personal data for that purpose, please contact us using the contact details set out at the start of this privacy notice.

                            addition, sometimes we may use some of your personal information together with other people’s personal information to give us statistical
                            information for our own purposes. Because this is grouped together with other personal information and you are not identifiable from that
                            combined data we are able to use this.
                            Under data protection laws, we can only use your personal information for the purposes we have told you about, unless we consider that
                            the new purpose is compatible with the purpose(s) we told you about. If we want to use your personal information for a different purpose
                            that we do not think is compatible with the purpose(s) we told you about, then we will contact you to explain this and what legal reason is
                            in place to allow us to do this.

                            Under data protection laws, you have certain rights in relation to your personal information, as follows:
                            a. Right to request access: (this is often called ‘subject access’). This is the right to obtain from us a copy of the personal information that
                            we hold about you. We must also provide you with certain other information in response to these requests to help you understand how
                            your personal information is being used.
                            b. Right to correction: this is the right to request that any incorrect personal data is corrected and that any incomplete personal data is
                            completed.
                            c. Right to erasure: (this is often called the 'right to be forgotten').This right only applies in certain circumstances. Where it does apply, you
                            have the right to request us to erase all of your personal information.
                            d. Right to restrict processing: this right only applies in certain circumstances. Where it does apply, you have the right to request us to
                            restrict the processing of your personal information.
                            e. Right to data portability: this right allows you to request us to transfer your personal information to someone else.
                            f. Right to object: you have the right to object to us processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You also have the
                            right to object to us processing personal information where our legal reason for doing so is the Legitimate Interests Reason (see section 4
                            above) and there is something about your particular situation that means that you want to object to us processing your personal
                            information. In certain circumstances, you have the right to object to processing where such processing consists of profiling (including
                            profiling for direct marketing).
                            In addition to the rights set out in section 9.1, where we rely on consent as the legal reason for using your personal information, you have
                            the right to withdraw your consent. Further details about this are set out in section 4.5.
                            If you want to exercise any of the above rights in relation to your personal information, please contact us using the details set out at the
                            beginning of this notice. If you do make a request, then please note:
                            a. we may need certain information from you so that we can verify your identity;
                            b. we do not charge a fee for exercising your rights unless your request is unfounded or excessive; and
                            c. if your request is unfounded or excessive, then we may refuse to deal with your request.

                            However, we will give you the opportunity to manage how or if we market to you. In any email that we send to you, we provide a link to

                            If you do request that we stop marketing to you, this will not prevent us from sending communications to you that are not to do with
                            marketing (for example in relation to goods and services that you have purchased from us).
